# Abstract 
We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional
block disordered subwavelength resonator systems subject to non-reciprocal damping,
induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the
adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution
of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral
properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a
transfermatrixapproach, wethenclarify, intermsofLyapunovexponents, thecompetition
between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation
due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation against
the non-Hermit
