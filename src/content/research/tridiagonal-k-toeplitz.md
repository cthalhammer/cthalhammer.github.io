## Abstract

We establish new results on the spectra and pseudo-spectra of tridiagonal k-
Toeplitz operators and matrices. In particular, we prove the connection between
the winding number of the eigenvalues of the symbol function and the expo-
nential decay of the associated eigenvectors (or pseudo-eigenvectors). Our
results elucidate the topological origin of the non-Hermitian skin effect in
general one-dimensional polymer systems of subwavelength resonators with
imaginary gauge potentials. We also numerically verify our theory for these
polymer systems.
