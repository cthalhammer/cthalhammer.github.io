## Abstract

We aim to characterise the spectral distributions of bi-infinite, semi-infinite,
and finite aperiodic one-dimensional arrays of subwavelength resonators, constructed by
sampling from a finite library of building blocks. By adopting the modern formalism of
uniform hyperbolicity, we are able to strengthen and rigorously prove a Saxon-Hutner-type
result, fully characterising the spectral gaps of the composite bi-infinite aperiodic system
in terms of its constituent blocks. Crucial to this approach is a change of basis from
transfer matrices to propagation matrices, allowing for a block-level characterisation.
This approach also enables an explicit characterisation of edge-induced eigenmodes in the
semi-infinite setting. Finally, we leverage finite section methods for Jacobi operators to
extend our results to finite systems – providing strict bounds for their spectra in terms of
their constituent blocks.
