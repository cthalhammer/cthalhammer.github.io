## The Approach

The journey to the Brenta Dolomites started early morning from Zürich. After a scenic drive through the Swiss and Austrian Alps, we arrived at Madonna di Campiglio in the late afternoon. The sight of the dramatic limestone towers of the Brenta Group immediately got us excited for the upcoming adventure.

## Day 1: Via delle Bocchette Centrali

We started early from the Rifugio Tuckett, taking the well-marked trail towards the via ferrata. The initial approach was relatively gentle, winding through beautiful alpine meadows before hitting the more technical terrain.

### Route Details
- **Grade**: D (Difficult)
- **Length**: ~4 hours
- **Exposure**: High
- **Key Sections**: The traverse sections with incredible exposure over the valley

The via ferrata itself was absolutely spectacular. The route follows an exposed ridgeline with dramatic drops on both sides. The steel cables and ladders were in excellent condition, and the route finding was straightforward.

## Day 2: Via delle Bocchette Alte

Building on yesterday's success, we tackled the more challenging Bocchette Alte route. This via ferrata is considered one of the classics in the Dolomites, and it certainly lived up to its reputation.

### Technical Highlights
- Vertical ladder sections
- Exposed traverses with incredible views
- A challenging downclimb section that required careful attention

The weather was absolutely perfect - clear blue skies and just enough breeze to keep us cool during the more strenuous sections.

## Gear Notes

Our gear setup worked perfectly for these routes:
- **Via Ferrata Set**: Petzl Scorpio with energy absorber
- **Helmet**: Essential for the rockfall-prone sections
- **Approach Shoes**: Better than boots for the technical sections
- **Light Rain Shell**: Mountain weather can change quickly

## Reflections

This trip reminded me why I love alpine climbing so much. The combination of physical challenge, stunning scenery, and the camaraderie of climbing with good friends makes for unforgettable experiences. The Dolomites continue to be one of my favorite climbing destinations - the rock quality is incredible, the routes are well-maintained, and the mountain huts provide excellent bases for multi-day adventures.

Already planning our return trip for next summer to tackle some of the longer multi-pitch traditional routes in the area!
